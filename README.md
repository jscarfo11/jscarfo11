## Hi!
I'm student at Purdue studying Computer Engineering!
I mostly create projects that revolve around [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), or [Sysbot Base](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase).

<p>
At the moment, it is just python, however I am going to be learning C and MatLab in the next couple of years while at Purdue, and C# whenever I get around to it.

  ### Contact
If for whatever reason you need to contact me, you can find me on discord at brains_. You can also probably find my latest project running on the discord below. Feel free to stop in and say hi!
